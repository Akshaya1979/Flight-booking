‚úàÔ∏è Flight Ticket Booking System using python
üîπ Project Overview
The Flight Ticket Booking System (FTBS) is a command-line based application developed using the Python programming language. It enables users to book flight tickets, manage passenger data, and handle reservations in an efficient and automated manner. The system provides core functionalities like booking, cancellation, rescheduling, and viewing records, making it ideal for small-scale travel agencies or educational projects.

üîπ Problem Definition
This project addresses the need for an automated reservation system for managing flight ticket bookings. It includes features to handle flight schedules, fares, passenger details, and ticket issuance. The system stores relevant passenger information like name, Aadhaar number, mobile number, and email ID. It also supports discounted fares for senior citizens, students, and armed forces. Additionally, it offers functionalities to cancel or reschedule a booking by updating the date and time of travel.

üîπ Key Functionalities
Book tickets and assign seats based on availability

Store and manage passenger details

Provide discounts for special categories (senior citizens, students, armed forces)

Allow cancellation or rescheduling of existing bookings

Generate and display e-tickets

Maintain and retrieve historical records of bookings

üîπ Rescheduling & Cancellation
For cancellation/rescheduling, the user must input their name, seat number, and number of seats.

In the case of rescheduling, the user also provides the new date and time, and an updated ticket is displayed.

‚úÖ Conclusion
The Flight Ticket Booking System developed in Python demonstrates practical usage of programming concepts such as conditional logic, loops, file handling, and data structures (like dictionaries and lists). This project offers an effective solution for managing flight bookings through a simple console interface and can be further expanded with a GUI or database integration in the future.
