# Flight-booking
 
 The Flight Ticket Booking System (FTBS) is a console-based application developed using the C programming language. This system facilitates users in booking flight tickets by assigning reservation seats, storing passenger information, and managing travel records. It mimics a basic airline reservation system suitable for small travel agencies looking to automate the ticketing process.

üîπ Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to create an automated reservation system that manages flight bookings efficiently. It handles flight schedules, fare details, passenger records, and ticket issuance. The system stores user data such as name, Aadhaar number, mobile number, and email. It also provides features like discounts for special categories (senior citizens, students, armed forces), cancellation, and rescheduling of tickets.

üîπ Key Functionalities
1.Assign flight seats based on availability

2.Store and manage passenger details

3.Offer discounts for special passenger categories

4.Allow cancellation or rescheduling of bookings

5.Display booking and payment information

6.Maintain historical records for reference

üîπ Rescheduling & Cancellation
To cancel or reschedule, the system requires input such as the passenger‚Äôs name, seat number, and number of seats.

For rescheduling, the user must also provide the new date and time, and a revised ticket is displayed.
